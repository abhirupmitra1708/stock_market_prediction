# Stock Market Prediction with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict stock market trends using machine learning techniques, specifically LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks and other predictive models. By leveraging historical stock data and applying advanced machine learning algorithms, the goal is to develop accurate predictions for future stock movements.

## Technologies Used
- Python: Main programming language used for development
- TensorFlow: Used for implementing LSTM networks and other machine learning models
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library
- NumPy: Fundamental package for numerical computing
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for various algorithms and tools
- Matplotlib: Plotting library for visualizing data and results
- Jupyter Notebooks: Interactive development environment for prototyping and experimentation

## Key Features
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering of historical stock data
- Model Training: Implementation of LSTM networks and other machine learning models for prediction
- Evaluation Metrics: Analysis of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualization: Graphical representation of historical data, predicted trends, and model performance
- Deployment: Options for deploying trained models for real-time prediction or integration into trading systems
